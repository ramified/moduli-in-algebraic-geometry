\section{Moduli of vector bundle}
The course lecture note \href{https://userpage.fu-berlin.de/hoskins/moduli_and_GIT.html}{``Moduli and GIT"} would be a perfect survey to begin with. We also refer to \cite{huybrechts2010geometry}. It's not easy to read, but It's in some sense completed, and everybody refers it.

For a variant, you may get some informations of moduli of vector bundles over elliptic curve in \cite{atiyah1957vector} and $G$-bundles over elliptic curve in \cite{frăţilă2020revisiting}.
