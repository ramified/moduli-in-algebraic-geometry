\section{Moduli of higher dimensional variety, MMP}
I would add something here if I know.
\subsection{Moduli of algebraic surfaces}
We know the Enriquesâ€“Kodaira classification, which contributes to a better understanding of algebraic surfaces. But that's not enough. Do we know the classification of K3-surfaces?
\subsection{MMP}
Here we refer to the survey \cite{xu2020kstability}, or the \href{https://math.mit.edu/~cyxu/Kstability.pdf}{updated version}. You can get a glimpse of the current progress in MMP (especially in the table of page 63).
